Lustre Plug-in for Eclipse with JKind Analysis Support

This plug-in provides a Lustre front-end in Eclipse with syntax
checking, highlighting, type checking, and other syntatic checks.
These plug-ins also provide a convenient way to launch JKind on a
Lustre file and have the results reported back in a real-time
graphical display. Excel formatted counterexamples viewable by
right-clicking on individual properties.
